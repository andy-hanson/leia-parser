Do I want to go to this place?
What's a good place to eat?
Where can I get something to eat around here?
Should I go to the nearby McDonald's?
Is it popular?
//Is it worth going to Burger King tonight?
Why do people like that?

Give me a general set of recommendations.
Find me something spicy.

As a rule, I do not eat anything that has meat. Any recommendations?
Is there a place that has local food?
Do you know a place that cooks food without salt?
//I'm watching my weight, what's a good place for me?

Is the Burger King still open?
How many people are usually in there?

//Have you ever been to KFC?
//Have I ever been to KFC?
//What's something nice people who've been to KFC say about it?
